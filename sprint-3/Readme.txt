Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) buckets are cloud storage containers used to store and organize data. Each bucket has a globally unique name and can hold an unlimited amount of data, accessible via HTTP/S requests. Buckets support features like versioning, access control, encryption, and lifecycle management for efficient data handling.
