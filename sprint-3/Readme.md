# Handwritten Digit Recognizer using Scikit-Learn and AWS S3

The Handwritten Digit Recognizer using Scikit-Learn and AWS S3 integrates machine learning and cloud storage for efficient image classification. The project typically uses the MNIST dataset, containing images of handwritten digits (0-9), which are pre-processed into a format suitable for machine learning. A model is trained using Scikit-Learn's algorithms like Logistic Regression or Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify digits. The trained model, after evaluation, is saved and stored in AWS S3 for easy access and deployment. The `S3Helper` class handles interactions with S3, facilitating the uploading of datasets, downloading models, and retrieving specific dataset portions for training or testing, providing seamless cloud integration.

In addition to its machine learning capabilities, the application benefits from AWS S3 for scalable and efficient data management. It minimizes storage concerns by allowing datasets and models to be stored and accessed remotely, while also enabling quick retrieval and deployment across different systems. The model's performance is optimized by pre-processing input images (resizing, normalization, and flattening), ensuring accurate predictions. This setup allows the application to scale easily, providing a fast and reliable solution for recognizing handwritten digits in cloud-based environments, where large datasets can be managed efficiently.
