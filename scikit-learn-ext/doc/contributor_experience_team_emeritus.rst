Watch for side road traffic to the right

Be ready to yield to other traffic entering the same lane

Watch right and left for cross traffic

Vehicles must not exceed the shown speed limit when the yellow light flashes

Prepare to reduce speed for a down grade

Watch for side road traffic to the right


Never pass another vehicle at this location

Return to normal highway speed after passing

Slow down for a low place in the road

Keep in the right-hand lane when driving slow
