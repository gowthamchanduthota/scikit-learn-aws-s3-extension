The scikit-learn-aws-s3-extension appears to be a tool designed for working with Scikit-learn models and data stored on AWS S3. One such implementation is provided in a project called s3 helpers. It allows for tasks like:

Listing and managing files in S3 buckets using patterns.
Moving and copying files between S3 buckets.
Reading and writing CSV and JSON files directly into/from Pandas dataframes without needing to download them locally.
Saving and loading Scikit-learn models directly to and from S3.
Installation
You need to configure AWS S3 as per standard practices for boto3 (environment variables or AWS CLI setup) and install the required library using:
pip install s34me
