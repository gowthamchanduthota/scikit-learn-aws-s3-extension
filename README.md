The scikit-learn-aws-s3-extension appears to be a tool designed for working with Scikit-learn models and data stored on AWS S3. One such implementation is provided in a project called s3 helpers. It allows for tasks like:

Listing and managing files in S3 buckets using patterns.
Moving and copying files between S3 buckets.
Reading and writing CSV and JSON files directly into/from Pandas dataframes without needing to download them locally.
Saving and loading Scikit-learn models directly to and from S3.

You can install the scikit-learn-aws-s3-extension from PyPI or from source.
The **S3 Helper** is a Python utility for easily interacting with AWS S3, supporting file upload, download, listing, and deletion. It leverages the `boto3` library and simplifies common S3 operations with methods to manage objects in a bucket. Set up requires AWS credentials, and operations are performed with a simple, intuitive API.
=======
You need to configure AWS S3 as per standard practices for boto3 (environment variables or AWS CLI setup) and install the required library using:
pip install s34me
